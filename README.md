Overview
BotNetSim is a high-volume web request simulator designed to send a large number of requests to specified URLs using multiple threads. The project simulates a botnet by creating a customizable number of bots that each sends repeated HTTP requests to the target website(s), using various user-agent strings to mimic different browsers and devices. It also handles connection retries and timeouts, ensuring robust and persistent requests.

Features
Multi-threaded Execution: Capable of running up to 2000 threads simultaneously to simulate large traffic.
Randomized User Agents: Utilizes a diverse list of user agents to make the requests appear as though they are coming from different browsers and platforms.
Session Management with Retries: Implements session handling with automatic retries for failed requests.
Error Handling: Graceful handling of connection issues, timeouts, and server-side errors (e.g., 403 Forbidden).
Queue-Based Task Management: Uses a queue to distribute tasks to worker threads efficiently.
Prerequisites
Before you can run this project, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
requests library (install using pip install requests)
urllib3 for handling retries and connection warnings
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/botnetsim.git
cd botnetsim
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install requests
Usage
Modify the URL list:

Edit the urls variable in the code to specify the target URLs you want the bots to access.
Set the number of bots and threads:

Adjust the total_bots and max_threads variables to fit your load simulation needs.
Run the bot simulator:

bash
Copy code
python botnetsim.py
Expected Output: The script will print the status of each bot accessing the URL, including successful connections and any errors encountered, such as timeouts or 403 errors.

Code Breakdown
create_session(): Creates a session with retry logic, allowing the bot to retry failed requests up to 5 times.
access_website(): Function where each bot sends repeated GET requests to a URL using randomized user-agent headers.
worker(): A thread worker that pulls tasks (bot IDs) from the queue and performs the requests.
main(): Sets up the queue and starts multiple threads to perform the web requests in parallel.
